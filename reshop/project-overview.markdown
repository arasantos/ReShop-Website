### ReShop Vision Statement
ReShop is a clothing store that allows people to sell, browse, and purchase quality second-hand clothing from one another.

### User Base

ReShop caters to both buyers and sellers of second-hand clothing, as they are one and the same. Users can seamlessly transition between these two groups while shopping.

### What is ReShop?

Sellers can put items up for sale, and can supply photos, a description, and a price for the item. Buyers can browse clothing put up for sale, as well as search for specific items. They can filter and sort their searches on a number of criteria such as price, clothing quality and clothing type. Buyers can purchase an item immediately. They will be able to enter their payment details to purchase the item in checkout.

In order to buy and sell items, users must register and create a profile. From their profile, users can manage their personal information such as name, username, and city. They will also be able to logout from their account. Their profile will also allow them to view items they currently have up for sale, as well as items they have bought.

Buyers will be able to view items on their home page. They will be able to search for a specific item. They can also sort and filter the results based on their preferences.

A userâ€™s payment details, address and contact information are private and not visible on their profile. Once a buyer purchases an item, their personal information such as address and contact information can be shared with the seller to facilitate delivery.

### Project Value

ReShop creates a vibrant community for shoppers of all fashion tastes to connect and participate in sustainable commerce. Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar thrift stores, ReShop is not limited to a physical location; it opens the door for buyers to explore a wide variety of fashion pieces, enabling sustainable shopping from anywhere. Buyers and Sellers share a universal profile look-and-feel, making it easy for buyers to start selling their own clothing with minimal change to their user experience and earn directly from their own products.

### Success Criteria

The success of the project will be measured on four criteria/goals:

* 10,000 registered users
* 2,000 items actively on sale
* 25 items sold per day based on transaction data
* $120,000 total revenue earned by users based on transaction data

Success will be reached if all goals are met within the first fiscal year of the project launch date.
