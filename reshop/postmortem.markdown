### What did we learn about team or large project development?
  - **Communication:** Working on a project with other people requires good and consistent communication. We needed to keep each other on the loop about which tasks are taken, and which tasks need to be taken. We also asked each other for help whenever we struggled with something in our task or misunderstood a code that someone else made. Whenever we needed help, we made it known to the group as not doing so can affect future tasks that rely on the task at hand.
  - **Retro Meetings:** We also held retro meetings to discuss the things that went well and the things that didn't for the last iteration. This allowed us to think of ways to improve our code and team!
  - **Code Reviews:** It's important to have another pair of eyes that will look over our code before merging it to our develop branch. This way, we can prevent as many mistakes as possible from getting merged.
  - **3-tier Architecture:** Having separate layers for our presentation, logic, and data made our code organized and easy to understand. This also made it easy to maintain and add changes to.
  - **Adaptability:** Things didn't always work out as what we hoped for. For example, some tasks took longer than expected, or some tasks revealed bugs that we had to fix. No matter what came to us, we learned to adapt to it. We prioritized the most important tasks, and we looked for ways to solve our bugs.

### What will we start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?
  - **New Knowledge:** Keep doing everything we learned for this project (e.g. communication, retro meetings, etc.)
  - **Collaborative Estimates:** Estimating tasks with our team in the beginning of the iteration allowed us to have a better understanding of expectations for the task.

### What went right in the development process?
- **Communication:** We communicated well when it comes to addressing an issue or helping one another when one of us was stuck on a task. When someone made a suggestion on our code, we listened and improved using their suggestion.
- **Code Reviews:** Merge request approval process made sure another person reviewed the code. This prevented any mistakes or bugs from getting merged, as well as ensured all of our time estimate and time spent are filled out.
- **Branching Strategy:** Having everyone create a branch for each issue that we worked on made it easier to review code. This also allowed us to start on a new issue while waiting for approval on another issue.
- **Applying Class Material:** Since the content that's covered in class were still fresh in our minds, it made it easier to apply those in our code.

### What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?
- **Image Processing:** Researching about how to save and process images on android studio, as well as applying the research, took longer than expected. We had to do trial and error to figure out the best way to work with images.
- **User Interface:** It took some time to learn it and get started. However, once that was done, it was fairly easy to implement.
- **Database:** Surprisingly, it was hard to set it up and run properly. We also faced multiple exceptions thrown regarding it.
- **Logic classes:** These took the least amount of time to implement.
